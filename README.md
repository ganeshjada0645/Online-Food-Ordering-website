This is a single page (unresponsive) website which is static. The sections of website are as follows:

Specialities section
Our recommendations section
Reviews section
Footer
Details


INTRO SECTION
a. Top Navigation Bar:

There is a top Navigation Bar which will redirect you to the different sections of the page. And when a link is clicked it will scroll smoothly to the section.
The navbar is fixed and will be at the same position even after scrolling the page. And it contains a logo of the restaurant.

b. Intro Page

The main intro Page is divided into two sections vertically (using flexbox). One side it has the cover page for the restaurant and the other has the name of the restaurant with a subtitle and a caption about restaurant.
It also has a button below the title to redirect to the Specialities section (Button can be check our specialities).


SPECIALITIES SECTION
This specialities section also has a title along with subtitle.
This section contains cards to show the special dishes.
The card has an image of the dish, a title, and also a sign showing if the dish is veg or non-veg (on the corner of the card). And below the title of the dish, there will be discount and a short description of the dish.
On the bottom right corner, there is price of the dish and these cards have some cool hover effects.
Beside the title, there is button saying "Add+" which will not work now (as there is no JS involved) but it only change its appearance to "Added (in green color)", used class name: focus to implement this.


RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION
This section again contain the dish cards but some more cards in this section.
This section is similar to the specialities section with the only added idea that I have added a search bar on the top of this section below the title and subtitle.
This search bar have a simple magnify icon and one will be able to type anything on the bar.

REVIEWS SECTION
This section have 2 parts of the page. The first part contains cards that have reviews of people for the restaurant. This card have an image of the person, their name, and their review.
The second part contains a simple form asking for review which contains fields like name, email, and their review. Also, I added a submit button for the form. Again this form will not work (as there is no JS involved).

FOOTER
The footer contain social media links. Here I have used icons to the social media links, such that clicking on the icons will redirect you to the link.
Here I also added demo links like terms and conditions, Privacy policy, Copyright information, etc in the footer section.
The links will open in a new tab.
Also added a back-to-top button that navigates us smoothly to the top of the page.
